This directory shows the results of using stegowiper against different types of images, 
either plain ones or embedding hidden information with different steganography algorithms.

You can use https://github.com/mindcrypt/visual-forensic-steganography to have a look to the 
different color and bit planes of the images to better appreciate how the different algorithms work, 
including stegowiper.
